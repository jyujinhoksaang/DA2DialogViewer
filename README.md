# Dragon Age 2 Dialog Viewer: Brain-Only Coding POC (UE5 Slate UI)
Dragon Age 2 Dialog Viewer in Unreal Engine 5 Slate/C++

**Project Thesis:**
As I can't use my arms, this project was a dedicated test of **LLM-assisted development** (voice-directed prompt engineering). I architected and fought the AI until it generated this functional Unreal Engine 5 Slate UI for reading Dragon Age II dialog.

**Dependencies / Out-of-Box Readiness:**
The code will compile, but the viewer **will not function without proprietary Dragon Age II data files** (e.g GDA, GFF and sound files). This repository is a technical blueprint of the generated code architecture.

**License:**
This project is released under the MIT License.
